"""Hand_Alg_2.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chris Blanks' adapted version of the network2.py:

5/13/2018:
 
Added a few functions that will prompt the user for NN information and abstract
duties away from the user. The main function, start_up(), is called directly
after its definition. Additionally, a few subfunctions were created that pass
unlabeled data into the network and outputs the result into a file.

Original comment:
An improved version of network.py, implementing the stochastic
gradient descent learning algorithm for a feedforward neural network.
Improvements include the addition of the cross-entropy cost function,
regularization, and better initialization of network weights.  Note
that I have focused on making the code simple, easily readable, and
easily modifiable.  It is not optimized, and omits many desirable
features.
