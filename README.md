# Digit-Recognizing-DNN-
This project is an adaptation of one of the NN created in the Neural Networks and Deep Learning textbook made by Michael Nielsen.

The original neural network script, "network2.py", by Michael allows a lot of customization of the NN (e.g. choosing hyperparamters, saving a NN, loading a NN).
